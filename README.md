# browserOS Overview

**Welcome to browserOS**, where it makes Linux (and other CLI machines) fun!

- Have you always wanted to keep your sudo apt-get machine but want a simpler user interface?
- Are you bored and want to try something new for command-line interfaces?
- Do you just simply want browserOS for fun?
- Do you have Python 3.9 or higher?
- Is it 2023 or later?

Well then, if you answered at least 3 out of 5 of those questions, I have the perfect solution for you: *browserOS!*

*browserOS* is an "operating system" for those wanting a simpler interface in console-based systems or any interface on their MicroPython device.

## How does it work?
State-of-the-art technology of course!
1. When you enter a command (let's say `list`) you activate the REPL loop, which stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.
2. You then enter the arguments in the different lines. In this case, it is the path "./"
3. When you enter the argument and hit enter, the 'Evaluate' part comes into play. It finds the appropriate set of instructions to do corresponding to the command *`list`* and gives the arguments to the instruction.
4. The instruction then calls a corresponding function to list the directory.
5. The function lists the directories and prints each file and directory. This is the 'Print' section.
6. The function then finishes and returns to the loop, where you can enter another command.

How does it work? State-of-the-art technology of course! Didn't I just say that?

Overall, browserOS is a fun little command-line interpreter made in Python to help ease the pain and suffering of Linux or PowerShell. Download now! NOW. */hj*
