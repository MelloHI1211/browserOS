# browserOS Overview
browserOS is a Python disk operating system. It is currently in development but is expected to reach beta by Version 0.3.
Compared to other "operating systems", browserOS has almost 20 commands (40 planned!) and can even start other programs. Because it is made from Python, it is easy to modify and add additional functions, commands, and features. It also has a version more flexible to MicroPython devices (specifically Raspberry Pi Picos).
